## Algorithms
* [K-Means Clustering](https://github.com/Jadams29/ML_From_Scratch/tree/master/K-Means_Clustering)



Generate K centroids and randomly place on the grid. Iterate over all nodes and assign them to one 
of the centroid based on which is closest to that node. Once all node have been assigned to a centroid, for each
 centroid calculate the mean of its assigned nodes. Move the centroid to the mean location. Iterate over the nodes
 again and assign them to the closest centroid, repeat until the centroids stop moving location.
 
 To determine an optimal number of centroids (K) you can use the elbow method. (DESCRIBE ELBOW METHOD)
